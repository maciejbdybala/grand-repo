# Grand Repository to document my journey

Repository to track progress towards a career in data engineering, science or analysis. This I think is more for myself than anyone else, but I keep it public anyway.

* Continued reading [GitHub and Git guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) - went as far as [Accessibility](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/managing-your-theme-settings)


**2024-03-04** 

* I continue reading [GitHub and Git guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) - this is a long read! I am now at [Communicating on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/communicating-on-github)
* Actually, I should also do a little work on an assignment I have for the [Computational Applied Mathematics](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/mst374) course I am doing. Deadline for this is 10 April 2024.
  *  This is actually a project in itself, to put some Python code I write for that course on GitHub. But then again, in order to do that, I need to properly go through the guide from above.
* I got registered with education.gituhb.com as I am doing the above mentioned module. I am awaiting the 'benefits' tab to be updated and will then aim to integrate it with GitHub
* Still keeping this link as I find it interesting: [The Popularity of Data Science Software](https://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/).

The [SQL for R Users](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/sql-for-r-users) was informative. Tonight I am going to read through this article - [the origin of SQL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/362384.362685). ETA: Have read about 2/3 of it, understood some bits to do with how data had been previously stored as trees (as in mathematics). Another addition, I think perhaps I will develop this into a static Quarto blog and then I will have a subpage with interesting links - this is one interesting link: [The Popularity of Data Science Software](https://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/).

This evening I intend to:
* finish going through the training [SQL for R Users](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/sql-for-r-users) to strengthen my foundation of SQL as I am now predominantly an R user.
  * Done, it was good. Now this article on [the origin of SQL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/362384.362685) - this is my cup to tea!
  * Otherwise, also watching [this talk by Ian Cook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwP5KdWSgqE) just now.
* continue reading [GitHub and Git guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

**2024-02-27** I have never managed to update (a habit I still need to get into fully), but I have started going through the training [SQL for R Users](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/sql-for-r-users) to strengthen my foundation of SQL as I am now predominantly an R user.

**2024-02-25**: I know I still have that general document on [GitHub and Git guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) to read. I will see if I get to read through it today, because another project that occured to me it would be good to dabble with is to produce a sleek CV in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html). I had made one a while ago using the LaTeX framework which was good enough for a few things I applied for. Mindful that I am targeting careers to do with data, I think having a CV in RMarkdown / Quarto will be more pertinent. Basically building my tools which I will then use to make stuff (career, projects etc). 

So for the nearest time, the two tasks are:
* finish reading [GitHub and Git guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)
* produce a CV in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html)
  * a template from [Schochastics](http://archive.schochastics.net/post/create-a-cv-with-quarto/)
  * the same (I think) article then kindly shared at [RBloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/07/create-a-cv-with-quarto/)
 
... hang on a second, since I have only installed Ubuntu very recently, I need to install R. By the same token, I might want to install Python too. I have been wondering whether it is better to start working in Visual Studio Code from the very beginning, or to still go for RStudio - found a potentially handy article on [how to set up VSC like RStudio](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/07/setting-up-vs-code-for-python-development-like-rstudio/)

As I have been setting up RStudio, it occurred to me that Ubuntu partition is rather small and I will potentially run out of space doing various analyses. I am going to split partitions more or less equally between Windows and Ubuntu, but in order to do that I should create a mirror image of Windows on my hard drive.
* So I now have my Windows backed up on an external hard drive. Since Ubuntu is freshly installed and yesterday I had been mostly battling with setting the resolution of second screen going, I am going to reinstall Ubuntu and set the partition there.
  * ETA: managed to sort out the partitions with booting Ubuntu from USB stick and using GParted. I also created a 11GB swap partition to aid my 12GB RAM.

I got a link to a bunch of trainings to do with GitHub - [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/).

**2024-02-24**: I set out to learn a collection of techniques and familiarize myself with tools to become a competent worker in the area of data in the shortest time possible. This builds on my experiences as an Assistant Statistician within the Scottish Government where I currently spend a good portion of my time working in PowerBI and R. I am also a participant of the Office for National Statistics Data Science Graduate Programme 2023-2025 and I hope this to be my main tool in the transition.

Recently I have read through the [Quality assurance of code for analysis and research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html "duck book") also known as the 'duck book'. I greatly enjoyed that read and settled on readng more such overarching documents. Today I am reading throught the [GitHub and Git guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).

I have finally plugged my laptop to the second screen to start working on this more seriously but then got stuck in a major way as the second (big) screen resolution is about 1200x800 and I cannot figure out how to change it. After several hours of trying, I am now going to try installing Ubuntu 20.04 instead of ubuntu 22.04 and see if this helps...

...retained Ubuntu 22.04 and managed to put together a solution! I think this is relevant enough for writing a separate piece about which I will now procede to doing.

I first started typing here for each day I do something with this project, but after only two days this turns into a very lengthy document so I am going to split the text into individual .md files corresponding to days.

ETA: I might try again to have all here!

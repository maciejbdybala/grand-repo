# Grand Repository to document my journey

Repository to track progress towards a career in data engineering, science or analysis.

**2024-02-25**: I know I still have that general document on [GitHub and Git guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) to read. I will see if I get to read through it today, because another project that occured to me it would be good to dabble with is to produce a sleek CV in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html). I had made one a while ago using the LaTeX framework which was good enough for a few things I applied for. Mindful that I am targeting careers to do with data, I think having a CV in RMarkdown / Quarto will be more pertinent. Basically building my tools which I will then use to make stuff (career, projects etc). 

So for the nearest time, the two tasks are:
* finish reading [GitHub and Git guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)
* produce a CV in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html)
  * a template from [Schochastics](http://archive.schochastics.net/post/create-a-cv-with-quarto/)
  * the same (I think) article then kindly shared at [RBloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/07/create-a-cv-with-quarto/)
 
... hang on a second, since I have only installed Ubuntu very recently, I need to install R. By the same token, I might want to install Python too. I have been wondering whether it is better to start working in Visual Studio Code from the very beginning, or to still go for RStudio - found a potentially handy article on [how to set up VSC like RStudio](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/07/setting-up-vs-code-for-python-development-like-rstudio/)

As I have been setting up RStudio, it occurred to me that Ubuntu partition is rather small and I will potentially run out of space doing various analyses. I am going to split partitions more or less equally between Windows and Ubuntu, but in order to do that I should create a mirror image of Windows on my hard drive.
* So I now have my Windows backed up on an external hard drive. Since Ubuntu is freshly installed and yesterday I had been mostly battling with setting the resolution of second screen going, I am going to reinstall Ubuntu and set the partition there.

**2024-02-24**: I set out to learn a collection of techniques and familiarize myself with tools to become a competent worker in the area of data in the shortest time possible. This builds on my experiences as an Assistant Statistician within the Scottish Government where I currently spend a good portion of my time working in PowerBI and R. I am also a participant of the Office for National Statistics Data Science Graduate Programme 2023-2025 and I hope this to be my main tool in the transition.

Recently I have read through the [Quality assurance of code for analysis and research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html "duck book") also known as the 'duck book'. I greatly enjoyed that read and settled on readng more such overarching documents. Today I am reading throught the [GitHub and Git guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).

I have finally plugged my laptop to the second screen to start working on this more seriously but then got stuck in a major way as the second (big) screen resolution is about 1200x800 and I cannot figure out how to change it. After several hours of trying, I am now going to try installing Ubuntu 20.04 instead of ubuntu 22.04 and see if this helps...

...retained Ubuntu 22.04 and managed to put together a solution! I think this is relevant enough for writing a separate piece about which I will now procede to doing.

Repository to track progress towards a career in data engineering, science or analysis.

2024-02-24: I set out to learn a collection of techniques and familiarize myself with tools to become a competent worker in the area of data in the shortest time possible. This builds on my experiences as an Assistant Statistician within the Scottish Government where I currently spend a good portion of my time working in PowerBI and R. I am also a participant of the Office for National Statistics Data Science Graduate Programme 2023-2025 and I hope this to be my main tool in the transition.

# Grand Repository to document my journey

Repository to track progress towards a career in data engineering, science or analysis. 

I first started typing here for each day I do something with this project, but after only two days this turns into a very lengthy document so I am going to split the text into individual .md files corresponding to days.

**2024-02-25**: I know I still have that general document on [GitHub and Git guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) to read. I will see if I get to read through it today, because another project that occured to me it would be good to dabble with is to produce a sleek CV in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html). I had made one a while ago using the LaTeX framework which was good enough for a few things I applied for. Mindful that I am targeting careers to do with data, I think having a CV in RMarkdown / Quarto will be more pertinent. Basically building my tools which I will then use to make stuff (career, projects etc). 

So for the nearest time, the two tasks are:
* finish reading [GitHub and Git guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)
* produce a CV in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html)
  * a template from [Schochastics](http://archive.schochastics.net/post/create-a-cv-with-quarto/)
  * the same (I think) article then kindly shared at [RBloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/07/create-a-cv-with-quarto/)
 
... hang on a second, since I have only installed Ubuntu very recently, I need to install R. By the same token, I might want to install Python too. I have been wondering whether it is better to start working in Visual Studio Code from the very beginning, or to still go for RStudio - found a potentially handy article on [how to set up VSC like RStudio](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/07/setting-up-vs-code-for-python-development-like-rstudio/)

As I have been setting up RStudio, it occurred to me that Ubuntu partition is rather small and I will potentially run out of space doing various analyses. I am going to split partitions more or less equally between Windows and Ubuntu, but in order to do that I should create a mirror image of Windows on my hard drive.
* So I now have my Windows backed up on an external hard drive. Since Ubuntu is freshly installed and yesterday I had been mostly battling with setting the resolution of second screen going, I am going to reinstall Ubuntu and set the partition there.
  * ETA: managed to sort out the partitions with booting Ubuntu from USB stick and using GParted. I also created a 11GB swap partition to aid my 12GB RAM.

I got a link to a bunch of trainings to do with GitHub - [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/).
